## 🚀 Getting started

### 🔧 Create a server by inheriting from 'tschm.flight.Server'

```python
>>> from tschm.flight import Server

>>> class TestServer(Server):
...     def f(self, matrices):
...          self.logger.info(f"{matrices.keys()}")
...          # Simple implementation for testing - just return the input
...          return {key : 2*value for key, value in matrices.items()}
```

All complexity is hidden in the class 'Server' which is itself a child
of the pyarrrow's FlightServerBase class. It is enough to implement
the method 'f' which is expecting a dictionary of numpy arrays. It will
also return a dictionary of numpy arrays.

### 🌐 Start the server locally

```python
>>> server = TestServer.start(host="127.0.0.1", port=5555)
```

### 🔄 Use a Python client for computations

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from tschm.flight import Client

>>> with Client(location="grpc://127.0.0.1:5555") as client:
...     output = client.compute(command="compute", data={"input": np.array([1,2,3])})

>>> print(output["input"])
[2 4 6]

```
